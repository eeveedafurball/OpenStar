#OpenStar
<h1 align="center">✨ Welcome to OpenStar! ✨</h1> <h2 align="center">Based on the Intellistar Project</h2>
OpenStar is a modern fork and continuation of the original Intellistar emulator project — an interactive, browser-based simulation inspired by classic weather systems like Weatherscan.
Built on the powerful Intellistar codebase, OpenStar brings updates, refinements, and new features while staying true to the original vision.

<h2>📌 What's New in OpenStar?</h2> - Built using the <a href="https://github.com/JesseWx2011/Intellistar">Intellistar</a> repository as a foundation. - Modernized code and UI updates. - More frequent maintenance and community input. - Extended configuration options. - Ongoing improvements based on user feedback and new ideas.
<h2>❤️ Special Thanks</h2>
A huge shoutout to the original Intellistar team for their hard work and creativity:
